**Word2Vec** is an iterative method. Its main idea is as follows:
- take a huge text corpus;
- go over the text with a sliding window, moving one word at a time. At each step, there is a central word and context words (other words in this window);
- for the central word, compute probabilities of context words;
- adjust the vectors to increase these probabilities.
