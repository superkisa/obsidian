Discriminative transformer models, including ROBERTA, ELECTRA, and ALBERT, share a common idea of improving upon the original transformer architecture and training techniques to enhance model performance. Here are the main ideas behind each of these discriminative models:

1. **ROBERTA (Robustly optimized BERT approach):**
    
    - **Idea:** ROBERTA builds on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) with a focus on improving pretraining and understanding of contextual embeddings.
    - **Key Features:**
        - **Dynamically masks** out different parts of the input sequence during training, using a larger mini-batch size. (У BERT одна и та же маска)
        - Removes the Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) objective used in BERT.
        - Uses a **larger training dataset** and **longer training schedules**, leading to improved model performance.
2. **ELECTRA (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately):**
    
    - **Idea:** ELECTRA introduces a more efficient and effective training method by replacing tokens in the input sequence and training the model to distinguish between real and replaced tokens.
    - **Key Features:**
        - Replaces a subset of input **tokens** with **incorrect** ones and trains the model to identify these "masked" tokens.
        - Utilizes a **generator and discriminator setup**, inspired by GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), to improve efficiency.
        - Achieves similar or better performance compared to BERT with fewer parameters.
3. **ALBERT (A Lite BERT):**
    
    - **Idea:** ALBERT aims to reduce the number of parameters in the BERT model while maintaining or improving performance.
    - **Key Features:**
        - Implements parameter reduction techniques such as **factorized embedding** parameterization and cross-layer parameter sharing.
        - Utilizes a **shared parameter strategy** to decrease the model's size without sacrificing performance (instead of having separate sets of parameters for each layer, certain parameters are shared among multiple layers)

In summary, ROBERTA focuses on robust optimization of the BERT model by adjusting training objectives and data augmentation. ELECTRA introduces an efficient training method inspired by adversarial learning. ALBERT aims to reduce the number of parameters in the BERT architecture while maintaining performance through innovative parameter-sharing strategies. These discriminative transformer models represent advancements in transformer-based architectures, offering improved efficiency, scalability, and performance in various natural language processing tasks.
