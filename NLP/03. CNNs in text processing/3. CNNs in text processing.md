CNN in text preprossesing using, for example, for tasks of finding some patterns througth the text (the task of classifying positive/negative sentiment of the text). 
Following the intuition above, <u>we want to detect some patterns, but we don't care much where exactly these patterns are</u>. This behavior is implemented with <u><b>two layers</u></b>:
- **convolution**: finds matches with patterns (as the cat head we saw above);
- **pooling**: aggregates these matches over positions (either locally or globally).
