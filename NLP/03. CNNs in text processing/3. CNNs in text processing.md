CNN in text preprossesing using, for example, for tasks of finding some patterns througth the text (the task of classifying positive/negative sentiment of the text). 
Following the intuition above, <u>we want to detect some patterns, but we don't care much where exactly these patterns are</u>. This behavior is implemented with <u><b>two layers</u></b>:
- **convolution**: finds matches with patterns (as the cat head we saw above);
- **pooling**: aggregates these matches over positions (either locally or globally).

Differently from images, texts have only one dimension: here a *convolution is one-dimensional.

A convolution is a linear layer (followed by a non-linearity) applied to each input window.
- $(x_1, ... , x_n)$ - representations of the input words, $x_i\in \mathbb{R}^d$;
- $d$ (input channels) - size of an input embedding;
- $k$ (kernel size) - the length of a convolution window (on the illustration, $k=3$);
- $m$ (output channels) - number of convolution filters (i.e., number of channels produced by the convolution).
