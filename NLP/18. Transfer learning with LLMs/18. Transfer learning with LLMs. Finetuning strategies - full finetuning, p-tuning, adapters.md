The concept of Transfer learning was first proposed in 1995 by scientist [Sebastian Thrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun) during his research in the field of artificial intelligence

researchers faced the problem that training each new model from scratch required immense computational resources and time. 
This issue became particularly acute with the growth of the complexity of models and the tasks they were meant to solve.

Transfer learning was the answer to this problem. It allowed the use of knowledge and experience gained in solving one task to be applied to another related task. This not only reduced the time and resources needed to train a new model but also enabled models to generalize knowledge across different domains and tasks.

The concept became a fundamental breakthrough in machine learning, as it opened new paths and training methods and allowed researchers and engineers to create more complex and powerful systems.
