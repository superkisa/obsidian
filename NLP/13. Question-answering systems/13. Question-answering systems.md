Question Answering (QA) Systems is an automated approach to retrieve correct responses to the questions asked by human in natural language. The fundamental thought behind QA system is to assist man-machine interaction.

QA systems can be based on various techniques, including [information retrieval](https://spotintelligence.com/2023/09/05/information-retrieval/), knowledge-based, generative, and rule-based approaches. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on the project’s specific needs.

## [Types of question answering](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Question_answering&action=edit&section=2 )

Question-answering research attempts to develop ways of answering a wide range of question types, including fact, list, [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition "Definition"), how, why, hypothetical, semantically constrained, and cross-lingual questions.

- Answering questions related to an article in order to evaluate [reading comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_comprehension "Reading comprehension") is one of the simpler form of question answering, since a given article is relatively short compared to the domains of other types of question-answering problems. An example of such a question is "What did Albert Einstein win the Nobel Prize for?" after an article about this subject is given to the system.
- _Closed-book_ question answering is when a system has memorized some facts during training and can answer questions without explicitly being given a context. This is similar to humans taking closed-book exams.
- _Closed-domain_ question answering deals with questions under a specific domain (for example, medicine or automotive maintenance) and can exploit domain-specific knowledge frequently formalized in [ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science) "Ontology (information science)"). Alternatively, "closed-domain" might refer to a situation where only a limited type of questions are accepted, such as questions asking for [descriptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_knowledge "Descriptive knowledge") rather than [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge "Procedural knowledge") information. Question answering systems in the context of machine reading applications have also been constructed in the medical domain, for instance related to Alzheimer's disease.
- _[Open-domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_domain#References "Open domain")_ question answering deals with questions about nearly anything and can only rely on general ontologies and world knowledge. Systems designed for open-domain question answering usually have much more data available from which to extract the answer. An example of an open-domain question is "What did Albert Einstein win the Nobel Prize for?" while no article about this subject is given to the system.

Another way to categorize question-answering systems is by the technical approach used. There are a number of different types of QA systems, including

- [rule-based systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_system "Rule-based system"),
- statistical systems, and
- [hybrid systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_intelligent_system "Hybrid intelligent system").

Rule-based systems use a set of rules to determine the correct answer to a question. Statistical systems use statistical methods to find the most likely answer to a question. Hybrid systems use a combination of rule-based and statistical methods.

## How does a natural language question-answering system work?

A natural language question-answering (QA) system is a computer program that automatically answers questions using NLP. The basic process of a natural language QA system includes the following steps:

1. **Text pre-processing**: The question is [pre-processed](https://spotintelligence.com/2022/12/21/nltk-preprocessing-pipeline/) to remove irrelevant information and standardise the text’s format. This step includes [tokenisation](https://spotintelligence.com/2022/12/07/nlp-tokenization/), [lemmatisation](https://spotintelligence.com/2022/12/09/lemmatization/), and [stop-word removal](https://spotintelligence.com/2022/12/10/stop-words/), among others.
2. **Question understanding**: The pre-processed question is analysed to extract the relevant entities and concepts and to identify the type of question being asked. This step can be done using natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as [named entity recognition](https://spotintelligence.com/2022/12/06/ner/), [dependency parsing](https://spotintelligence.com/2023/10/22/dependency-parsing/), and [part-of-speech tagging](https://spotintelligence.com/2023/01/24/pos-tagging-in-nlp-python/).
3. **Information retrieval**: The question is used to search a database or corpus of text to retrieve the most relevant information. This can be done using information retrieval techniques such as keyword search or semantic search.
4. **Answer generation:** The retrieved information is analysed to extract the specific answer to the question. This can be done using various techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, rule-based systems, or a combination.
5. **Ranking**: The extracted answers are ranked based on relevance and confidence score.

The specific methods used in each step and the system’s architecture will depend on the QA system’s design and the type of questions it intends to answer.

For example, some systems are based on a knowledge base, others on information retrieval, and others on [generative models](https://spotintelligence.com/2023/10/24/generative-models/). Hybrid systems can also be designed to combine several approaches to improve overall performance.

It’s also worth noting that the quality of the input data, pre-processing, tokenisation, and the model’s architecture are essential to achieve an excellent question-answering system.

Training a QA model requires a large dataset of questions and corresponding answers.

## Types of question answering system

Question answering (QA) implementation in natural language processing (NLP) involves using various NLP techniques to answer questions in natural language automatically. There are several different approaches to QA implementation in NLP.

1. Information retrieval-based QA

Information retrieval-based question answering (QA) is a method of automatically answering questions by searching for relevant documents or passages that contain the answer. This approach uses information retrieval techniques, such as keyword or semantic search, to identify the documents or passages most likely to hold the answer to a given question.

Information retrieval-based QA systems are generally easy to implement and can be used to answer a wide range of questions. However, their performance can be limited by the quality and relevance of the indexed text and the effectiveness of the retrieval and extraction methods used.

It’s also important to note that IR-based QA systems are often used with other types of QA, like knowledge-based or generative QA, to improve the system’s overall performance.

2. Knowledge-based QA

Knowledge-based question answering (QA) automatically answers questions using a knowledge base, such as a database or ontology, to retrieve the relevant information. This strategy’s foundation is that searching for a structured knowledge base for a question can yield the answer.

Knowledge-based QA systems are generally more accurate and reliable than other QA approaches based on structured and well-curated knowledge. But their performance can be limited by how well the knowledge base is covered and how well the methods used to make queries and get information from their work.

It’s also important to note that knowledge-based QA systems are often used with other QA methods, like information retrieval-based or generative QA, to improve the overall performance of the QA system.

3. Generative QA

Generative question answering (QA) automatically answers questions using a generative model, such as a neural network, to generate a natural language answer to a given question.

This method is based on the idea that a machine can be taught to understand and create text in natural language to provide a correct answer in terms of grammar and meaning.

Generative QA systems are powerful as they can answer a wide range of questions and generate more human-like answers.

However, their performance can be limited by the training data’s quality and diversity and the model’s complexity.

It’s also worth noting that Generative QA systems are often used with other QA approaches, such as information retrieval-based or knowledge-based QA, to improve the overall performance of the QA system.

These combinations are known as Hybrid QA systems.

4. Hybrid QA

Hybrid question answering (QA) automatically answers questions by combining multiple QA approaches, such as information retrieval-based, knowledge-based, and generative QA. This approach is based on the idea that different QA approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, and by combining them, the overall performance of the QA system can be improved.

Hybrid QA systems are considered more robust and accurate than a single QA approach, as they can leverage the strengths of multiple QA methods. Hybrid QA systems can also be more flexible, as they can adapt to different types of questions and different levels of complexity. But designing and putting together a hybrid QA system can be more complex and take more resources than a single QA method.

Hybrid QA systems can be built to be used in a specific domain or a general-purpose QA system. In both cases, the system’s performance will depend on the [data quality](https://spotintelligence.com/2023/04/07/data-quality-machine-learning/), pre-processing, tokenisation, and the model’s architecture.

5. Rule-based QA

Rule-based question answering (QA) automatically answers questions using a predefined set of rules based on keywords or patterns in the question. This approach is based on the idea that many questions can be answered by matching the question to a set of predefined rules or templates.

Rule-based QA systems are generally simple and easy to implement. Still, their performance can be limited by the coverage and completeness of the rules and the effectiveness of the [pattern matching](https://spotintelligence.com/2023/07/10/name-matching-algorithm/) and extraction methods used. In addition, rule-based QA systems are more prone to errors and can only handle questions covered by predefined rules.

It’s also worth noting that rule-based QA systems are often combined with other QA approaches, such as information retrieval-based, knowledge-based, or generative QA, to improve the overall performance of the QA system. In these cases, the rule-based QA can filter out irrelevant answers and improve the efficiency of the comprehensive system.

All of these approaches require significant training data, including questions and their corresponding answers, to improve the accuracy of the QA system.

Additionally, the quality of the input data, pre-processing, tokenisation, and the model’s architecture is essential to achieve a good question-answering system.

## Applications of question and answering systems
