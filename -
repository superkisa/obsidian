# Since Windows and Linux use different default line endings, Git may report 
# a large number of modified files that have no differences aside from their 
# line endings. To prevent this from happening, you can disable line ending 
# conversion using a .gitattributes file or globally on the Windows side.

# Typically adding or modifying a .gitattributes file in your repository is the 
# most reliable way to solve this problem. Committing this file to source control 
# will help others and allows you to vary behaviors by repository as appropriate.
