### Cross-Entropy Method - Tabular Case:

#### Question 1:
**Q:** Explain the fundamental idea behind the Cross-Entropy Method in the tabular case.

**A:** The Cross-Entropy Method in the tabular case is an optimization algorithm used for solving discrete and combinatorial problems. It involves iteratively generating random samples, evaluating their performance, selecting the top-performing samples, and updating the distribution to favor the generation of better samples.

#### Question 2:
**Q:** What is the role of the objective function in the Cross-Entropy Method (tabular case)?

**A:** The objective function in the tabular Cross-Entropy Method serves as the metric to evaluate the performance of generated samples. It quantifies how well a given solution performs in the optimization task. The method aims to iteratively improve the distribution of solutions based on the objective function.

#### Question 3:
**Q:** Describe the key steps involved in the tabular Cross-Entropy Method.

**A:** The key steps in the tabular Cross-Entropy Method include:
1. **Initialization:** Set up an initial distribution over the solution space.
2. **Generate Samples:** Randomly sample solutions from the distribution.
3. **Evaluate Solutions:** Assess the performance of each sampled solution using the objective function.
4. **Select Top Solutions:** Identify the top-performing solutions.
5. **Update Distribution:** Adjust the distribution parameters to favor the generation of similar top solutions.
6. **Repeat:** Iteratively execute steps 2 to 5 for a fixed number of iterations.

### Cross-Entropy Method - Approximate Case:

#### Question 4:
**Q:** How does the Cross-Entropy Method extend to the approximate case?

**A:** In the approximate case, the Cross-Entropy Method deals with continuous and high-dimensional solution spaces. It involves parameterizing the distribution, such as using a neural network, to represent the policy. The optimization process is similar to the tabular case, but it operates in a continuous space.

#### Question 5:
**Q:** Explain the concept of parameterized distribution in the approximate Cross-Entropy Method.

**A:** In the approximate Cross-Entropy Method, a parameterized distribution refers to representing the solution space using a set of parameters. This often involves using a neural network to model a policy or a probability distribution over the continuous solution space. The parameters of the network are updated to improve the performance of generated samples.

#### Question 6:
**Q:** What challenges does the approximate Cross-Entropy Method address compared to the tabular case?

**A:** The approximate Cross-Entropy Method addresses challenges in dealing with continuous and high-dimensional solution spaces. The use of a parameterized distribution, often implemented with neural networks, allows the method to handle complex and continuous optimization problems that the tabular method may struggle with.
