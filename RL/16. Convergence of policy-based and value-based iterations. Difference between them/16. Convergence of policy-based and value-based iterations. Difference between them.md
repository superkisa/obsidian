Policy-based and value-based methods are two different approaches in reinforcement learning. They differ mainly in how they update the policy and value functions during the learning process.
**Policy-based Methods**
Policy-based methods directly optimize the policy function. They generate new actions based on the current policy and update the policy parameters based on the observed rewards and states. These methods often use techniques like stochastic gradient ascent or policy gradients to perform these updates. Examples of policy-based methods include REINFORCE and Actor-Critic methods.

**Value-based Methods**
Value-based methods, on the other hand, optimize the value function, which represents the expected return (total discounted future reward) for each state-action pair. Once the value function is learned, the policy can be derived from it by choosing the action that maximizes the expected return in each state. Examples of value-based methods include Q-learning and Value Iteration.
**Convergence**
In terms of convergence, both policy-based and value-based methods are guaranteed to converge to the optimal policy if the environment is finite and has a well-defined optimal policy. However, the rate of convergence can vary. For instance, value iteration guarantees convergence to the optimal values in a finite number of steps, regardless of the complexity of the environment [1](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/ml-value-iteration-vs-policy-iteration). On the other hand, policy-based methods may require more iterations to converge, especially in complex environments, due to the exploration-exploitation trade-off inherent in policy optimization [2](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/407230/what-is-the-difference-between-policy-based-on-policy-value-based-off-policy).
It's also worth mentioning that policy-based methods are generally easier to implement and understand compared to value-based methods, making them popular choices for many applications.
